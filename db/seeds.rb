# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# 2.times do
#   Team.create!(name: Faker::Team.name, owner: Faker::Name.name, account_id: 1)
# end

# 21.times do
#   Player.create!(name: Faker::Name.name, rating: rand(1..10), account_id: 1)
# end

# 3.times do
#   Team.create!(name: Faker::Team.name, owner: Faker::Name.name, account_id: 3)
# end
